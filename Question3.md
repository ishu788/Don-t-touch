## Viruses:

Viruses are malicious software programs that infect other files on a computer by attaching themselves to them. They spread when these infected files are executed. Viruses can cause various harmful effects, such as data loss, system instability, or unauthorized access.

## Worms:

Worms are self-replicating malware programs that spread across networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in network services or by using social engineering techniques. Unlike viruses, worms do not need to attach themselves to existing files to propagate. They can spread rapidly and consume network bandwidth, causing performance issues and facilitating the spread of other malware.


## Trojans:

Trojans, short for Trojan horses, are deceptive malware programs that disguise themselves as legitimate software or files. Once executed, they perform malicious actions such as stealing sensitive information, installing backdoors for remote access, or downloading and installing additional malware onto the victim's system. Trojans often rely on social engineering tactics to trick users into running them.

## Ransomware:

Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim's files or locks them out of their system, demanding a ransom payment in exchange for restoring access. It typically spreads through malicious email attachments, compromised websites, or exploit kits. Ransomware attacks can cause significant financial and data loss for individuals and organizations.

## Spyware:

Spyware is a type of malware designed to secretly monitor and gather information about a user's activities on their computer or device. This information can include keystrokes, browsing history, login credentials, and personal or financial data. Spyware often operates stealthily, making it difficult for users to detect its presence.

## Adware:

Adware is a type of malware that displays unwanted advertisements or redirects users to advertising websites without their consent. While not inherently malicious, adware can degrade system performance, disrupt user experience, and compromise privacy by tracking browsing habits and collecting personal information for targeted advertising purposes.

## Rootkits:

Rootkits are stealthy malware programs designed to conceal their presence and maintain privileged access (root-level or administrator-level) to a compromised system. They often modify system files, processes, or kernel components to evade detection by security software and enable persistent control over the infected device. Rootkits are commonly used as backdoors for remote access or to facilitate other malicious activities, such as espionage or data theft.
