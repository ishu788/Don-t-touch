## Parts of Linux a Regular User Would Know?

A regular user would typically interact with the shell, file system, processes, user accounts, permissions, and possibly some basic system utilities.

## Phishing Attacks?

Spear Phishing: Targets specific individuals or organizations with personalized messages to trick them into divulging sensitive information or performing actions.

Whale Phishing (also known as "CEO Fraud" or "Business Email Compromise"): Targets high-profile individuals like CEOs or executives within organizations to deceive them into authorizing fraudulent transactions or revealing confidential information.

## Stateful vs. Stateless Firewalls?

Stateful Firewall: Keeps track of the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic. It can inspect packets at the network and transport layers.

Stateless Firewall: Filters packets based solely on predetermined criteria such as source/destination IP addresses and ports, without considering the state of connections.

## Forward Proxy Servers?

Forward proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and the internet, forwarding requests from clients to servers and returning responses back to clients. They can cache frequently accessed content to improve performance and provide anonymity for clients.

## Types of Hypervisors?

Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal): Runs directly on the host's hardware without the need for an underlying operating system. Examples include VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V.

Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted): Runs on top of a host operating system. Examples include VMware Workstation and Oracle VirtualBox.

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)?

EDR solutions monitor endpoint devices for suspicious activities, detect and investigate security incidents, and provide response capabilities to mitigate threats.

## What to Do if Suspecting Email Compromise (Indicators of Compromise)?

- Check for unusual account activity or login attempts.
- Look for unexpected changes in email settings or forwarding rules.
- Investigate reports of suspicious emails or attachments from the client's contacts.
- Monitor for unusual network traffic or connections from the client's device.

## Phases of the Cyber Kill Chain?

- Reconnaissance
- Weaponization
- Delivery
- Exploitation
- Installation
- Command and Control (C2)
- Actions on Objectives

## Personal Network Hardening?

- Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.
- Keep software and firmware updated.
- Use a firewall and antivirus/antimalware software.
- Encrypt sensitive data and communications.
- Be cautious of suspicious emails, links, and downloads.
- Regularly back up important data.

## Zero-Trust?

Zero-trust is a security model based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that threats may exist both inside and outside the network perimeter and requires strict identity verification and access controls for every user, device, and application attempting to connect to resources.
