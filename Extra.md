## Left alone with company computer?

I would like to clarify that I approach computer security with a strong commitment to ethical behavior and adherence to legal and organizational guidelines. If I were to find myself in a situation where I had access to a computer system, my actions would be governed by ethical considerations and organizational policies.

Rather than attempting to exploit the system, I would use my access to identify and report any security vulnerabilities or weaknesses to the appropriate personnel within the organization. This might involve conducting vulnerability assessments, reviewing system configurations, or analyzing security logs to identify potential risks.

I believe that transparency, collaboration, and a proactive approach to security are essential in protecting computer systems and sensitive data. Therefore, my priority would be to work with IT security professionals to address any identified issues and strengthen the overall security posture of the organization."


## Zero Trust

Zero Trust is a security concept and model that assumes that threats may exist both outside and inside the network. Traditional security models typically rely on perimeter-based defenses, assuming that everything inside the network is trustworthy. In contrast, Zero Trust operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify."


## TCP vs UDP 

-  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
    - Connection-oriented: Establishes a connection before data transfer.
    - Reliable: Ensures ordered and error-checked delivery of data.
    - Slower but more reliable.
    - Examples: Web browsing, email, FTP.

- UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
    - Connectionless: No prior connection setup.
    - Unreliable: No guaranteed delivery or order of data.
    - Faster but less reliable.
    - Examples: Real-time communication (VoIP, video calls), online gaming, DNS

## Can you tell me about the main differences between AWS and Azure? When would you use one over the other

AWS and Azure are leading cloud platforms, but they have some key differences. AWS has been around longer and has a larger market share

- network segmentation
- continous monitoring
- IAM
- Regular Security assessments

## What are the implications of applying MDM solutions to non-corporate owned devices

- always keep personal and professional data separated


## Whatâ€™s the difference between AV and Endpoint Detection?

Antivirus (AV) primarily focuses on detecting and blocking known malware threats using signature-based methods. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) provides broader visibility and advanced detection capabilities, including behavioral analysis and threat hunting, to detect and respond to a wide range of security threats, including advanced and zero-day attacks. EDR solutions offer real-time response capabilities and proactive threat hunting, making them essential for modern endpoint security.
